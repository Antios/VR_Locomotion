This was some work I did for testing different locomotion techniques using the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset.
Originally this was supposed to use a form of manual redirected walking, however the limitations of babylon js proved to be to difficult to make that possible. Now this version uses a form of flying movement where the direction of flight is dictated by the right controller.

NOTE: Github cant upload files greater then 100Mb so this excludes the map .glb asset however the locomotion logic itself remains so all you
would need to do is download your own map asset.
